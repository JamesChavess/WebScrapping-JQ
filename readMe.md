 ## I loved the challenge it was really fun it has been an honor and a privilage to write and present this code 

###In this Repo has 2 initial files "scrapper" and "officialScrapper"

###scrapper works for all purposes, its a 40+ live code file

### officialScrapper also should work just as well if jquery is already running in browser, it is an optimized 14 line file


I was envolving and getting to like jquery so alot of snippets were replaced by cleaner simplistic code that you see now

the data that could be retreived straight forward was assigned directly to the json object.

the arrays and object values were passed through a generic function to return the desired data types and names 
solicited

### automatic download was implemented for convinience, dont think im sending you a virus when you run the code!!

.......
!Taking advantage that in was granted a little bit more time i set myself out to create a checklist that would 
help us revise data that was been collected
 
Some bug fixes were set up data collected that sometimes comes duplicated or blank, 
!but incase if we cant snip them in the butt generically this seemed like a fast way to validate data before downloading it

I havent finished this second part and its almost 3 am so I will try to pick up where I left off later in morning before turning this in
