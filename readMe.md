 @@ I loved the challenge it was really fun this Code was a privilage and an honor to write and present this code @@

As you will be able to see in the scrapper.js file I have left you all my prior working code 
I was envolving and getting to like jquery so alot of those are snippets that seemed too long or overly specific

the data that could be retreived straight forward was assigned directly to the json object

the arrays and object values were assigned a generic function to return the desired data types and names 
compatible with other code

- automatic download was implemented for convinience, dont think im sending you a virus when you run the code!!

! Taking advantage that in was granted a little bit more time i set myself out to create a checklist that would 
help us revise data that was been collected

 
Some bug fixes were set up data collected that sometimes comes duplicated or blank, 
!but incase if we cant snip them in the butt generically this seemed like a fast way to validate data before downloading it

-I havent finished this second part and its almost 3 am so I will try to pick up where I left off later in morning before turning this in
